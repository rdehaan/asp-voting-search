## TODOs

### New features

- [ ] Encode strategyproofness (as two profile property)
- [ ] Check if scoring rule + Pareto + strategyproofness leads to inconsistency
- [ ] Find more/better symmetry breaking constraints for the guessing of profiles
- [ ] Think of other way to characterize Borda, and see if we can find it using a new voting rule specification language
